This repository contains solutions for Data Science Tools and Techniques assignment

Question 1
1)var1 Creation and Printing:
->Create a variable var1 that stores an array of numbers from 0 to 30.
->Reshape it into different dimensions for var2 and var3.
->Perform slicing operations and observe effects of reshaping.
->Use the numpy sum function with axis arguments to sum over different dimensions.
2)Indexing and Broadcasting:
->Use 2D array indexing to modify elements and check if reshaping affects the original array.

Question 2
1)Broadcasting with Scalars:
->Perform basic arithmetic operations with a scalar and array using broadcasting.
2)Matrix Operations:
->Generate a 10x10 matrix with specific element-wise operations.
->Simulate data using random distributions and standardize it using mean and standard deviation.

Question 3
1)Vandermonde Matrix Generation:
->Generate a Vandermonde matrix using broadcasting.
->Solve a linear system using the matrix inversion and numpy's solve function.
